I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Docker Containers, is in fact OCI Containers, or as I've recently taken to calling it, runtime-spec plus image-spec.
Docker Containers is not a OS-Level virtualization layer unto itself, but rather another proprietary implementation of the OCI Container specification made by the Open Container Initative, cgroups and namespaces providing the isolation as a container as defined by the runtime-spec. 
any containers run in a modified version of the OCI Container specifications every day, without realizing it. 
Though a peculiar turn of events, the version of the container spec which is widely used today is often called "Docker Containers", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the OCI Specification, developed by the Linux Foundation. 

There really is a Docker, and these people are using it, but it is just a wrapper on top of the system that they use. 
Docker is the wrapper: the program which makes the syscalls to isolate the machine's resources to the individual processes, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete container defintion. 
Docker is normally used in combination with the OCI Container specifications: the whole system is basically OCI Containers with Docker added, or OCI/Dock. All the so-called "Docker Containers" are really just OCI Containers.
